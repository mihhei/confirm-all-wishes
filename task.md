## Frontend pre-assignmentâ€”Droppe Xmas ðŸŽ„
Abstract Youâ€™re building an intuitive cart approval process for parents. That is, a flow with high usability for an imaginary christmas gift picking marketplace. The primary user persona of your interface will be a 50 year old parent with differing (usually low) levels of tech nativeness. Story Imagine youâ€™re the parent of 5 children. Itâ€™s just before christmas. Your children have each collected a wish list of gifts (products for which you will pay for) in a service called Droppe Xmas ðŸŽ„â€”these carts or wish lists are represented by a cart in fakestoreapi.com/docs. You want to be able to approve some of these gift wishes and discard some. In other words, one easy interface & approval flow for aggregating all 5 wish lists.

As a parent (user) you might have different ways to decide what the main criteria is for approving or discarding a giftâ€”to optimize savings, optimize for everyone to get their favourite gifts, optimize that all children will get an equal amount of gifts, optimising that their well behaved child will get more gifts than others. As developers and designers we cannot be sure what these exact decision processes areâ€”the user could even approve or discard all wishes. However, weâ€™ve identified that controlling spend is one of the most important factors and relating features should therefore be emphasized when building these interfaces. Implementation Pull 5 carts from the APIâ€”one per child, it should be visible which cart is which childsâ€™ The user can interact with these carts in an intuitive way to manage spending and other possible aspects that are important for decision making The user should get a discount if there are identical products on different childrens carts and the user approves these wishes 2 identical products chosen => 20% reduction for the sum of those two items 3 identical products chosen => 30% reduction â€¦ and so onâ€”these reduction rules are to be saved and handled on the client, the API doesnâ€™t support this When the user has made the final choices of approving certain products, these choices should be pushed to the API. Save both approved and discarded carts per child to the API The user should see a final confirmation screen with an easy overview of the new data saved on the APIâ€”aggregated approved cart with possible relating savings as well as an aggregate disregarded cart overview Keep in mind the different criteria for optimisation depending on user personas

Estimated workload: 5 hours

Keep these things in mind Data abstraction in application & state Modularity of code (reusable patterns, components) Client-server data transfer frugality (when are we fetching what and why) Automated testing (what is valuable to test and how)

What we value Prioritization, recognise whatâ€™s actually valuable Clean code, code quality, modularity & scalability Usability, translate requirements into features & flows, utilize patterns & atomic design Confidence, ability to clearly justify the reasoning behind your choices

Fake Production API: https://fakestoreapi.com/, handle this api and itâ€™s documentation as it would be our production grade apiâ€”that is, the code should handle it in the same way as in a production environment and its interactions should be tested as such.

Limitations: The interface is highly usable, aesthetic, and designed user-first without using any external UI library or CSS framework.

Recommend Technologies: Nextjs, React, Typescript, css preprocessor for styling. Using create next or create react app as boilerplate is allowed.

Final tips: Submit the assignment by sending (as a reply to the email you received) us a link to the Github repository and make sure we can access it. Remember to include a README.md with instructions to get the application running. Double check everything before returning the code.
